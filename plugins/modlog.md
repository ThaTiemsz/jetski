# Modlog

The modlog plugin provides a mechanisim for logging various events and actions to one or more channels. The intention of the modlog is to provide a private feed of server events that administrators and moderators can use to better monitor and audit users actions. The modlog is extremely configurable, and thus fairly complex.

## Commands

| Name | Description | Default Level | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `!modlog hush` | Disables tracking of message deletes in modlog | Global Admin | `!modlog hush` |
| `!modlog unhush` | Re-enables tracking of message deletes | Global Admin | `!modlog unhush` |

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ignored\_users | A list of user ids which are ignored in the modlog. This is useful for ignoring bots that regularly delete or edit their messages | list | empty |
| ignored\_channels | A list of channel ids which are ignored in the modlog. This is useful for ignoring private or high-activity channels | list | empty |
| new\_member\_threshold | The number of seconds an account is considered new | int | 900 \(15 minutes\) |
| channels | Mapping of channel names/ids to ModLog Configurations | dict | empty |
